Write a function that takes in the head of a linked list and an integer k and returns the shifted linked list.

Example 1: If k is a multiple of the linked list size, then return the head. 
Example 2: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and k = 2 returns 4 -> 5 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
Example 3: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and k = -2 returns 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 0 -> 1

Constraints: k is an integer.
