Write a function that takes in two array of equal lengths whose entries represents the height of a student. Assume that half of the students are wearing red shirts and the other half
are wearing blue shirts. You want to arrange the students in two rows before photo. Each row should contain the same number of students and follow the guidelines:

a) All students wearing red shirts are in the same row
b) All students wearing blue shirts are in the same row
c) Each student in the back row is strictly ltaller than the student in front of them. 

You're given an input named redShirtHeights, blueShirtHeights containing heights of students wearing red and blue shirts, respectively. Assume the arrays are the same length, and
each height is a positive integer. The function should return whether a class photo can be taken with these guidelines or not (True or False). 

You may assume each class has at least 2 students. 

Example: 

redShirtHeights = [5, 8, 1, 3, 4]
blueShirtHeights = [6, 9, 2, 4, 5]

Output: True - blue shirt students are in the back row.
