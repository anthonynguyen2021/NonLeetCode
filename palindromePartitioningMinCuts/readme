Given a non-empty string, write a function that returns the minimum number of cuts needed to perform on the string such that
each remaining substring is a palindrome. Another way to formulate this is what is the smallest partition size of the string such that
each of its components is a palindrome.


Sample input: 

string = "noonabbad"

Sample Output:

2  # noon | abba | d
