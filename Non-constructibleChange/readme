Given an array of positive integers representing the value of coins in your pocket, write a function the returns the minimumm amount of change (the minimum sum of money) that you CANNOT create.
The given coins can have any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have duplicates). We implicitly assume that we can't take a coin twice (only at most once)

For instance, if you're given coins = [1, 2, 5], the minimum amount of change that you can't create is 4. If you're given no coins, the minimum amount of change that you can't create is 1.

Example: coins = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]. Output = 20.
