You're given a class named "Node" that has 'name' and 'children' atrributes. We use a set of Node class instances to form a tree.

Write a function that implements the depthFirstSearch function in the class Node, which takes in an empty array, traverse the 
tree using the depth first search approach (specifically navigating the tree from left to right), stores all of the nodes' names 
in the input arary, and returns it.

Example: 

Graph =             A
                 /  |   \
                B   C    D
               / \      /  \
              E   F    G    H
                 / \    \
                I   J    K
                
Output = ['A', 'B', 'E', 'F', 'I', 'J', 'C', 'D', 'G', 'K', 'H'].
