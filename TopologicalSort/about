Input: jobs = [1, 2, 3, 4]

deps = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [3, 2], [4, 2], [4, 3]].

We have jobs labeled 1, 2, 3, 4. [1, 2] means that job 1 is a prerequisite for job 2. Get the topological ordering of this directed
graph. To do so, jobs with no prerequisites are appended to the output. Then delete those nodes and links. Then repeat and append
jobs with no prerequisites.
