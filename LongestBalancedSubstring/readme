Write a function that takes in a string made up of parenntheses '(' and ')'. The function should return an integer representing the length
of the longest balanced substring with regards to parentheses.

A string is said to be balanced if it has as many opening parentheses as it has closing parentheses and if no parenthes is unmatched.
Note that an opening parenthesis can't match a closing parenthesis that comes before it, and similarly, a closing parenthesis can't 
match an opening parenthesis that comes after it.

Input: string = "(()))("
Output: 4  # the longest balanced substring is "(())".
