You're given an array of arrays where each subarray holds two integer values and represents an item; the first integer is the item's value while the second represents the item's weight. You're also given a max capacity of a knapsack that you have.

You want to maximize the value of the items without exceeding the weight of your knapsack. It's assumed that you can pick an item at most once. 

Sample Input: items = [[1, 2], [4, 3], [5, 6], [6, 7]], capacity = 10. Note that it's important that the weight are ordered by increasing order with no loss in generality and that the item values should increase strictly.
