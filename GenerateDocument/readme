Write a function that takes in two strings of characters named characters and document, respectively, and you want to find out if you use the symbols in characters to generate the
symbols in document. Note that if document has 4 instances of 'a' and characters has 3 instances of 'a', you return false. 

The document you're trying to create may contain any charaters, including special characteres, capital letters, numbers, and spaces. Note that you can always generate the empty string 
"". 

Example: characters = "Bste!hetsi ogEAxpelrt x ", document = "AlgoExpert is the Best!". Output: True.
