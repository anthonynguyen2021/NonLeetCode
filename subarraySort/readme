Write a function that takes in an array of at least two integers and returns an array of starting & ending indices of the smallest
array (contiguous) in the input array that needs to be sorted in place in order for the entire input array to be sorted (from smallest
to largest). 

If the input is already sorted, the function should return [-1, -1].
