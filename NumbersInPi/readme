Numbers in Pi:

Given a string representation of the first n digits in Pi and a list of pisitive integers (all in string format), write a function that
returns the smallest number of spaces that can be added to the n digits of Pi such that all resulting numbers are found in the list of 
integers.

Note that a single number can appear multiple times in the resulting numbers. For instance, if Pi is '3141' and the numbers are
['1', '3', '4'], the number '1' is allowed to appear twice in the list of resulting numbers after inserting three spaces: '3 | 1 | 4 | 1'.

If no number of spaces can be added or partition of the string can be formed so each part of the partition corresponds to the list of
strings, the function should return -1. 

Input:

pi = '3141592653589793238462643383279'
numbers = ['314159265358979323846', '26433', '8', '3279', '314159265', '35897932384626433832', '79']

Output: 
2  # '314159265 | 35897932384626433832 | 79'
