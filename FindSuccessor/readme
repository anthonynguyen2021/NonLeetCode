Write a function that takesin a Binary Tree (where each node will have a parent attribute) as well as a node contained in that tree and returns the given node's successor. 
By node's successor, we mean the next node in the in-order tree traversal. 

Idea: If the node has a right child R, that may be next in line if it has no left-subtree. Otherwise, we must look at the left most child in R. Now, suppospe node has no right child.
Set current to be node. If current has no parent, return None. If current is equal to current.parent.left, return current.parent. Otherwise, set current = current.parent. In the end, 
return current (depending on your implementation). See the diagram for inspriation.
