Write a class that supports the following:

a) Continuous insertion of numbers with an inserst method which computes the median of all numbers inserted so far.
b) The instant O(1) retrieval of the median of all numbers inserted so far by a getMedian method. 

A median of list of numbers x_1, ..., x_n (assuming this list is sorted) is the middle number; if there's no middle number, average the middle two.
