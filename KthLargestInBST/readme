Given a BST and a positive integer k, the function should return the kth largest intger contained in the BST. 

We may assume that there are only integer values in the BST and that k <= # nodes in the BST. 

For the sake of this problem, we may assume that 2nd largest of {5, 7, 7} is 7. 

Our definition of a node is a BST node if the node's value is more than all of its left subtree nodal values and less than or equal to all of its right subtree nodal values.
