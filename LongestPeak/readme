write a function that takes in an array of integers and return the largest peak length. A peak is defined to be at least 3 continguous array entries such that arr[i-1] < arr[i] < arr[i+1].
Note that between adjacent elements to the left of the apex, it must be strictly increasing; to the right, it must be strictly decreasing. 

1, 4, 10, 2 forms a peak. Note that 4, 0, 10 does NOT.  Also, 1, 2, 2, 0 does NOT. Also, 1, 2, 3 does NOT form a peak (it's missing terms that are strictly decreasing to the right of 3).

Example: array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 3]. Output = 6 # 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3.
