Input: A binary tree. Write a function that returns a list of its branch sums ordered from leftmost branch sum to the rightmost branch sum. 

A branch sum is the sum of all values in a Binary Tree branch. A Binary Tree branch is a path of nodes in a tree that starts at the root node and ends at any leaf node. 

The class BinaryTree node has integer value, a left child, and a right child. Children nodes are either class BinaryTree or Null.
