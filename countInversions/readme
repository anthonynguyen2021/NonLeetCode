Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the number of inversion in
the array. An inversion occurs if for any valid indices i and j, i < j and array[i] > array[j].

For instance, given array = [3, 4, 1, 2], there are 4 inversions. The following pairs of indices 
represent inversions: [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3].

Intuitively, the number of inversion is a measure of how unsorted the array is.

Input:

array = [2, 3, 3, 1, 9, 5, 6]

Output:

5
