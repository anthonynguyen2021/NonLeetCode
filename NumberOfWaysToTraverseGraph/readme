You are given two positive integers representing the width and height of a rectangular lattice. Write a function that returns the number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the lattice
when starting at the top left. Each move, you can only move down or right. 

Example: width = 2, height = 3, our grid looks like this

x-x
| |
x-x
| |
x-x

Note that x is where you can stand. This has 3 possible moves. 

We may assume that width * height >= 2. So you can never have a grid of 1x1.
