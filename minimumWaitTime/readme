You're given a non-empty array of positive integers each representing the amount of time that specific task takes to execute. Only one task can be executed at a time and we can execute
the task in any order. A task's waiting time is the amount of time it must wait before its execution starts. For instance, the nth task waiting time is the sum
of the first, ..., n-1 tasks. 

For instance, given tasks [1, 4, 5] and we were to execute the tasks in the order [5, 1, 4], then we have 0 time waiting for first task. Second task takes 5 units. Last task takes 
5 + 1 units. 

You may mutate the input array.

Example: tasks = [3, 2, 1, 2, 6]

Output = 17.
