Write a function that takes in an array (m x n where m may equal to n) and returns a list of values in the matrix that is traversed in a clockwise traversal. 

Example:

array = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [12, 13, 14, 5], [11, 16, 15, 6], [10, 9, 8, 7]]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
